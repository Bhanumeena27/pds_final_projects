## Projects


### Project 1 : 





### Project 2 : 




### Project 3 : ISBI 2022 Accepted Submissions Analysis
1. The project aims to analyse the accepted submissions of ISBI 2022. The dataset is located in the `data/isbi2022/` directory. 
2. The dataset comprised of multiple `json` files. `JSON` stands for `J`avaScript `O`bject `N`otation. It is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. 
3. Each json file contain the information about multiple papers(about 100 papers in each). The information about the paper is stored in the form of key-value pairs. `JSON` is all about key-value pairs (aka `dictionaries` in Python).
4. Each paper contains more than 20 attributes, but the most useful attributes are listed as follows : 
   - `articleTitle` : Title of the paper
   - `authors` : List of authors of the paper
   - `citationCount` : Number of citations of the paper
   - `downloadCount` : Number of downloads of the paper
   -  `startPage` : Starting page of the paper
   -  `endPage` : Ending page of the paper
   -  `abstract` : Stripped abstract of the paper
5. The project can be divided into sub-areas as follows : 
   - `Data Preprocessing`
        1. Write functions to read to multiple json files and concatenate them into a single dataframe.
        2. Also only keep the useful attributes mentioned above and drop the rest.
   - `Data Analysis`
        1. In this part you can prepare a set of questions at least 15 and answer them using the dataset.
        2. Some examples questions to get you started:
            * On which `area` of ISBI 2022, the most number of papers were submitted?
            * Which are the `top 10` downloaded papers and what are they about?
            * Which are the `top 10` cited papers and what are they about?
            * What are the `mean` and `median` number of `authors` per paper?
            * Most common words in the abstracts of the papers? Form a `word cloud`.
            * What is the `average` number of `pages` per paper?
            * And so on... Get creative and come up with your own questions.
   - `Data Visualization`
        1. In this part you can make use of the `matplotlib` and `seaborn` libraries to visualize the answers to the questions you asked in the previous part.
        2. Everyone likes to see the results in the form of `graphs` and `charts`. So, make sure you visualize the answers to the questions you asked in the previous part.
